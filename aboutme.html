      <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">A leader and go-getter determined to stand out in his field</h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Jesús I. Feliciano-Batista was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Throughout his life and career, Jesús has worked diligently and passionately to earn the trust and respect of peers and superiors. As a young man with experience in positions of leadership, Jesús considers his reliability, responsibility, sense of duty, professionalism, and overall work to be important in his future success. Moreover, Jesús believes in getting far in life with a “go-getter” mentality, preferring to create and earn opportunities rather than just wait for them.</p>
       <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">As a young professional in the field of sports journalism, Jesús has worked reporting on basketball, soccer/football, baseball and college sports. Before even graduating from high school, Jesús worked as an employee for an independent contractor. Here, he learned the value of being efficient while also paying attention to detail, teamwork and leadership. He followed that up by working freelance with a film director as an assistant, where he learned the importance of organization and allowing others to express themselves in order to allow a project to evolve. Jesús would continue to apply those values during internships and future jobs. After starting his bachelor's degree, Jesús realized he needed to find opportunities for himself, as they would not come to him. Jesús emailed local newspapers and online outlets offering his services for free, mostly resulting in rejections. After some months of persisting and looking to create his opportunities, Jesús landed three of them: two in sports media and one in a local newspaper. 
       </p>
       <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
       During this time, Jesús developed his love for sports and sports journalism. Moreover, more than just the games, Jesús likes to focus on the people on the field, court, rink, or track, sharing their stories and perspectives. As a follower, reader and admirer of media outlets like The Athletic, ESPN, Bleacher Report, The Ringer, SI and Enjoy Basketball, among others, Jesús believes he can contribute to a team as a reporter, leader and an agent of change regarding the ways sports are viewed and covered.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed">Feliciano-Batista graduated high school without a clear idea of what he wanted to do with his life. He only knew he loved to write, so he attended Puerto Rico's best communications and journalism school. Here, he developed a passion for the subject and decided this was what he would dedicate his life to.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed">Not satisfied with just the classroom, Jesús decided to look for opportunities to develop his craft with real-world experience. This led Jesús to an internship with Major League Baseball, work with The Gondol and an internship with Puerto Rico Posts. The latter of these earned Jesús a job a few months after joining the team as an intern, and he would quickly earn the respect and trust of his bosses. By the end of his time with the newspaper, he was a journalist and assistant editor.</p>

Following their advice, he applied and was accepted into The Newhouse School's Magazine, News and Digital Journalism masters program, in the Sports Media and Communications track, with a merit-based full scholarship. Here, Feliciano-Batista is looking to develop a sports magazine for future students who share his passion, will work as the Lead Sports Producer at TheNewsHouse.com, beat reporter for Syracuse.com and continue to develop his skills in the field. </p>

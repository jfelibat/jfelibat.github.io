Syracuse University sophomore Braeden Cheverie-Leonard is the face of esports at the school. Ask a student with a passion for the field and they will send you his way, as will professors at the sports management program. Cheverie-Leonard has even been asked to join faculty during interviews for people filling roles related to esports at Syracuse, said Director of Sports Management Michael Veley.

After joining Syracuse last year, Cheverie-Leonard has taken on an important role as student-voice in the process of developing Syracuse’s varsity esports program, as well as the new Esports Communications and Management degree that the school will launch next fall.

“I think I am the voice,” Cheverie-Leonard said of his role in Syracuse esports. “Joey's (Gawrysiak) the one who can actually get things done, but he kind of lets me rant, and gets things done.”
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Cheverie-Leonard, captain of the Call of Duty club team at Syracuse, sees himself as the biggest reason why the school will start competing at esports tournaments in more than just a club level. There was not much of a structure before he got to the school, much less any staff to develop the structure. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
When Cheverie-Leonard arrived, the Call of Duty club team was not even practicing and had not played a game in three years. He helped revive the team by recruiting players and entering them into competitions. The first season was “tough,” but he kept pushing to draw more attention to the team and turn it from club to varsity. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Still, his freshman year in Syracuse was not easy. Despite hating to hear the word “no,” it followed him everywhere. The process of building up the team was full of negations. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
On the club level, Cheverie-Leonard was proactive in trying to use his experience to better develop the teams. He approached last year’s president with ideas for tournaments and budget uses that were rejected. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
It was difficult to get things done and timetables were constantly changing. He also hated the idea of calling the Call of Duty team a club team, as he considered the team’s schedule to be as competitive and intensive as varsity-level sports. Syracuse policy makes the team wear shirts that say “club” on them. 
            </p>

<section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
The team’s captain taped over the word. To this day, Cheverie-Leonard uses the shirt with the tape.  
            </p>

    <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
His frustration even led him to consider transferring elsewhere. Cheverie-Leonard said this was never a real option, but he felt limited by the whole process Syracuse was implementing and that the school was not doing enough to develop the program. 
            </p>

    <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“I appreciate all the money and time we're putting into building this, but the longer we wait, the less time I have left,” Cheverie-Leonard said. “Every day that passes, other schools are catching up on developing their programs, and we need to be the first, we need to be the best.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
This changed during his sophomore year, and Cheverie-Leonard believes it will continue to change as the program comes together and positions are filled. 
            </p>

         <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“I think the results are going to come easier now that we are actually establishing a program. I feel like there's going to be a lot less obstacles now that we actually have staff members and it's not just some student wanting to do this,” he said. 
            </p>

         <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
This year, Syracuse hired Joey Gawrysiak as executive director of esports. This was more than just a sign of support from the university, but a new voice with the power to actually change things and move the process forward.
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Cheverie-Leonard was asked to join the call where Gawrysiak interviewed for the position. The school wanted student input, and he was a clear choice for Veley. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Veley first got to know Cheverie-Leonard during a class trip to Los Angeles as part of a course – “Sport Management LA Immersion.” Here they began talking, and two elements stood out about the student: his passion for esports and personality, said Veley. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“He’s locked in. This is his passion, this is what he wants to do. He generates his own stimulation and wants to learn. Because of that, he can walk into a room and carry on a conversation with a company president before the age of 20. He's not intimated, but he’s not cocky or arrogant,” Veley said. “He lights up the room.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Gawrysiak was Cheverie-Leonard's preference to fill the position, and the two have already collaborated in developing the program. This semester, Gawrysiak requested the student’s opinion on the search for a new competitive director, an important person who will oversee the competitive teams and recruitment. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Gawrysiak asked Cheverie-Leonard to his office to discuss some aspects regarding logistics and facilities. At the end of the meeting, the executive director gave the student a batch of ten résumés and asked him to rank them. They compared candidates and notes until they agreed on the better picks. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Cheverie-Leonard’s No. 1 choice was Gawrysiak’s third. The candidate is now the favorite for the position. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“It's really humbling, and really exciting. Everybody says I play a big role in this, and I do, but to actually see: ‘hey, come into my office, I want to run something by you,’ and then to get a pile… It felt really rewarding,” said Cheverie-Leonard. “I think I looked in the mirror and laughed. It was like, ‘this is really happening?’ It's really cool.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Gawrysiak also keeps Cheverie-Leonard up to date regarding the academic side of the program. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“Joey and I try to pencil in an hour meeting every week, but we probably text cumulatively over an hour a day. Whether that's: ‘hey, this is the physical construction update with facilities,’ or ‘I just got this position approved,’ or ’I just drafted up this course. What are your thoughts?’ That's a daily thing,” Cheverie-Leonard said. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Cheverie-Leonard’s role in the academic side is smaller than his role with the team, but he has no problem with that. Despite his past frustrations and fatigue in his work, the sophomore still considers this a passion.   
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“I'm very passionate about getting my team to a point to compete for a national championship, which is a very difficult and long road ahead of us. But I think we can do it,” Cheverie-Leonard said. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“When he gets passionate about something, he puts his efforts into it…That passion and that drive has helped him,” said Kris Leonard, Braeden’s father. “It’s what has pushed him, and he's had some success that has really validated his ability.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
His role in developing the program continues to evolve as the process itself evolves. While he recognizes he can’t do much in terms of action, he also knows his influence as the face for esports on campus. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Cheverie-Leonard met for a one-on-one breakfast and tour with a prospective competitive director three weeks back. The candidate is his No. 1 option for the role, and, if hired, the esports club team will officially become a varsity team. The sophomore will also make a presentation in front of the university’s board of trustees regarding esports and the varsity team. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“There was only one piece of Syracuse missing, and it was the esports program; he wished they had a program at the varsity level, and now he's working towards creating that,” said Janelle Cheverie, Braeden’s mother. “So, he took the college that matched 99% of what he was looking for, and added that 1%. He has worked hard at doing so and being a pivotal part in that.”
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Still, Braeden is just a sophomore. He has priorities he must get to; it's not just meetings with the people in charge of developing the program. 
            </p>
        
        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Cheverie-Leonard believes he is at a crossroads in his life and career. As a sports management major, his career goal is to be the general manager of a team, or a coach, or maybe even an owner. He recently took an interest in sales as well and is considering this as a future career. He’s not even sure if esports are in his future.
            </p>



  <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
His parents do not mind. It was a risk to pick Syracuse when other schools offered him more money, but they were proud of their son for following his passion. Whatever move he decides to make, their pride and support won't change.  
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“The biggest thing that I've tried to instill in him is to make a difference, and to find a passion. He has done both of those,” said Janelle Cheverie.
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“He's definitely got the skills to make it work, and the passion that he really wants to push through on it. So, I'm proud as hell of him,” said Kris Leonard. Leonard highlighted his son’s responsibility and commitment as well. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Braeden takes his role as captain seriously. He tries to be the first one in the esports room before practices and the last one to leave, while making sure his team is up to the task ahead. 
            </p>
        
        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
The team captain holds and leads practices that can reach eight hours in length, only to then keep tabs on his teammates about habits and practicing outside of their scheduled meetings. On days where the team meets for less than five hours, he logs into the game and checks up on the time each player puts in. You have to play at least five hours per day to be a starter on the team. 
            </p>




              <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
To make sure the varsity team is ready to go next semester, he needs to make sure the team practices and understands the newest Call of Duty. There will be pressure to win in the first year and justify the program. It's all part of the process. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
Braden arrives at the esports room in the Barnes Center. He sets up his station and boots up the most recent Call of Duty game. The team starts practice and, halfway through, one of his teammates complains about his hangover. 
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
The teammate stands up, stretches and starts doing jumping jacks.
            </p>

        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“Looks like you had fun,” Braeden says, he has already informed the team they will be practicing all weekend, so there will be no time for drinking or hangovers.
            </p>
        
        <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“There’s nothing to do this weekend, anyway,” his teammate says.
            </p>

 <section id="article">
            <p class="paragraph">
“There’s CoD to do this weekend,” Braeden replied, before putting his headset on and resuming practice.             </p>
